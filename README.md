## Virtual Museums

Once registered and logged in, a user is able to preview over 50 museums, and buy a ticket for a virtual tour of the choosen museum. The ticket is sent to the user's email,
and user will be notified by mail 1 hour before the tour starts, as well as 5 minutes before its end. 
A museum preview includes basic information about the museum - phone number, address, museum type, a brief description, its location on map and a weather forecast
for three randomly chosen cities from the museum's country. 
Users are also able to read the news from arts and culture.
